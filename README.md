# Kalman-Filter-Linear-Quadratic-Estimation-
The particle x is moving in a line under random forces and damping. At a given time t, it have a location and velocity that follows some rule. We simulated 100 samples of particle state x and the measurements y. Then, we have plotted its locations' and plotted the Kalman filter estimations on the same plot.
Finally, we computed the MSE of the y measurements and the Kalman filter estimations.
